# Overview
Traditionally, tree-based models are used for and are highly effective at detecting fraud in credit card transations. However, recent research has shown that deep learning models may also perform as well or better than tree-based models. This project was used to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the performance of various deep learning models (RNNs, GRUs, LSTMs,  and temporal convolutional networks (TCNs)) as well as tree-based models. Refer to `Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.pdf` for an in-depth report
on the project.

The results show that deep learning models were comparable to tree-based models when comparing across multiple performance
metrics (precision, accuracy, F1, recall). In particular, the LSTM model and TCN with attention slightly outperformed all tree-based models in accuracy and F1 score.
